# Info-Covid-19
In this repository, we will create a time series proportional symbol map with Leaflet and JQuery. This  exercise is modified from 
https://cartographicperspectives.org/index.php/journal/article/view/cp76-donohue-et-al/1307 .

This map represents total of covid cases per region. The choice to work on regions is justified by the nullified cases in the region of Fes-Meknes.
